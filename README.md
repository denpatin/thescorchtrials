# Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. Trailers.

## Goal

What I am intending to do is a kind of a bitext collection for each pair of the below languages. Parallel texts are rather popular nowadays but the fields wherefrom the sources for them can be taken are infinite, and this makes it possible to gather such narrow-focused texts like trailer transcriptions for such a purpose.

## Languages

Currently, not so many languages are available due to my foreign language ignorance.

1. Russian
1. Hungarian

## Todos

* Get trailers for more languages
* Transcribe the videos
* Format the resulting transcriptions
* Perform an alignment for all the language pairs
* Implement a quick search for whatever pair

## Contribution

Feel free to PR whatever language you find a trailer in. You will just need to manually transcribe the video. If it is your mother language, I believe there will be no problem at all.

Thank you in advance!
